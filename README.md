# Redgate's Honeycomb web toolkit demo

To install the web toolkit and build the demo site:

1. Open a terminal window at the root directory of the checkout
2. Run `npm install` to install the projects dependencies, including the Honeycomb web toolkit
3. Run `npm run build` to build the demo site

This will create the `dist` directory which you'll need to serve using a web server of your choice.
